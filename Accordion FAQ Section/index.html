                    Javascript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                    conforms to the ECMAScript specification. Javascript is high-level,
                    often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.

                <h3>It is easy to learn HTML and CSS ?</h3>

                    HTML and CSS are partners that work together to create web pages.
                    And while they might be team mates, HTML and CSS visually look 
                    different, and they function differently too. So while you'll have
                    to learn both, it's easy to learn HTML and CSS together at the same 
                    time. They aren't hard.

                    Web development is the building and maintenance of websites, it's 
                    the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look 
                    great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
